# TextTranslator
It is a basically text/sentence translator application where we can write in the textbox sentence/text in any langauge and translate any other languages which one you prefer through the dropdown list. <br />
with the help of express, nodemon and inbuilt NodeJs api translate and some other packages of NodeJs.<br />
Using html,css and bootstrap, i did implement the textbox for contain or sentence/test writing, dropdown list for prefer the language which one you translate and one button.<br />
express is a web application framework of Nodejs to handle multiple different http requests at a specific url.<br />
NodeJs or Node is an open-source, cross-platform, java runtime environment that executes the JavaScript code outside of a web browser.<br />

<b> Step for installation of NodeJs packages/dependency and translate api.<b/> <br />
         
<b>step-1:<b/> need to install Nodejs and visual studio code <br />
<b>step-2:<b/> In visual studio code we must need install some plugins of nodejs like(NodeJs Modules Intellisense, NodeJs Extension Pack and  VS Code for Nodejs - Development Pack)<br />
<b>step-3:<b/> After installation of plugins must need to install some npm (Node Package Manager) then go to the visual studio terminal and perform below task <br />
         firstly, need to istall express (npm -i express) - express is a web application server framework <br />
         secondly, install nodemon (npm -i nodemon) - It is a tool that helps develop NodeJs application automatically, restarting the node application when file changes int the                      directory are detected.<br /> 
         finally, need to install google translate api (npm -i @vitalets/google-translate-api) - A free and unlimited API for Google Translate(for Node.js) <br />

<b>Step-4:<b/> After succesfull installation of package and dependency need to create index file in visual studio code and paste the above code of index.js file code. <br />
<b>Step-5:<b/> And finally, create EJS(Embedded JavaScript Templating) file where we can write the HTML code. <br />

EJS can inject data into HTML Template at the client side and produce the final HTML. <br />
