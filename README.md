# TextTranslator
It is a basically text/sentence translator application where we can write in the textbox sentence/text in any langauge and translate any other languages which one you prefer through the dropdown list.
with the help of express, nodemon and inbuilt NodeJs api translate and some other packages of NodeJs.
Using html,css and bootstrap, i did implement the textbox for contain or sentence/test writing, dropdown list for prefer the language which one you translate and one button.
express is a web application framework of Nodejs to handle multiple different http requests at a specific url.
NodeJs or Node is an open-source, cross-platform, java runtime environment that executes the JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

Step of installation of NodeJs packages and translate api
step-1: need to install Nodejs and visual studio code 
step-2: In visual studio code we must need install some plugins of nodejs like(NodeJs Modules Intellisense, NodeJs Extension Pack and  VS Code for Nodejs - Development Pack)
step-3: After installation of plugins must need to install some npm (Node Package Manager) then go to the visual studio terminal and perform below task
         firstly, need to istall express (npm -i express) - express is a web application server framework
         secondly, install nodemon (npm -i nodemon) - It is a tool that helps develop NodeJs application automatically, restarting the node application when file changes int the                      directory are detected. 
         finally, need to install google translate api (npm -i @vitalets/google-translate-api) - A free and unlimited API for Google Translate(for Node.js) 

Step-4: After succesfull installation of package and dependency need to create index file in visual studio code and paste the above code of index.js file code.
Step-5: And finally, create EJS(Embedded JavaScript Templating) file where we can write the HTML code.

EJS can inject data into HTML Template at the client side and produce the final HTML.
